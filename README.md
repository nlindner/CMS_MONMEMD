# CMS_MONMEMD
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Monthly Member Data (MONMEMD) file import using MS SQL.

A 'split' process has been developed to allow users to view 1 record for each month the member was active. (this is particular useful if looking at the data from a financial persepective)

Important Note:
The table tbl_MONMEMD_Month should contain 1 record for each year/month for all the years/months covered by the data in tbl_MONMEND
